The Euclidean Algorithm is a technique for quickly finding the GCD of two integers.

The Algorithm

The Euclidean Algorithm for finding GCD(A,B) is as follows:

    If A = 0 then GCD(A,B)=B, since the GCD(0,B)=B, and we can stop.  
    If B = 0 then GCD(A,B)=A, since the GCD(A,0)=A, and we can stop.  
    Write A in quotient remainder form (A = B⋅Q + R)
    Find GCD(B,R) using the Euclidean Algorithm since GCD(A,B) = GCD(B,R)

Example:

Find the GCD of 270 and 192

    A=270, B=192
    A ≠0
    B ≠0
    Use long division to find that 270/192 = 1 with a remainder of 78. We can write this as: 270 = 192 * 1 +78
    Find GCD(192,78), since GCD(270,192)=GCD(192,78)

    A=192, B=78

    A ≠0
    B ≠0
    Use long division to find that 192/78 = 2 with a remainder of 36. We can write this as:
    192 = 78 * 2 + 36
    Find GCD(78,36), since GCD(192,78)=GCD(78,36)

    A=78, B=36

    A ≠0
    B ≠0
    Use long division to find that 78/36 = 2 with a remainder of 6. We can write this as:
    78 = 36 * 2 + 6
    Find GCD(36,6), since GCD(78,36)=GCD(36,6)

    A=36, B=6

    A ≠0
    B ≠0
    Use long division to find that 36/6 = 6 with a remainder of 0. We can write this as:
    36 = 6 * 6 + 0
    Find GCD(6,0), since GCD(36,6)=GCD(6,0)

A=6, B=0

    A ≠0
    B =0, GCD(6,0)=6

So we have shown:

  GCD(270,192) = GCD(192,78) = GCD(78,36) = GCD(36,6) = GCD(6,0) = 6

  GCD(270,192) = 6
