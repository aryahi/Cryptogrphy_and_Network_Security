The Chinese remainder theorem is a result about congruences in number theory and its generalizations in abstract algebra. 
It was first published in the 3rd to 5th centuries by Chinese mathematician Sun Tzu.
In its basic form, the Chinese remainder theorem will determine a number n that when divided by some given divisors leaves
given remainders. For example, what is the lowest number n that when divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, when divided by 
5 leaves a remainder of 3, and when divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 2?
The original form of the theorem, contained in the 5th-century book Sunzi's Mathematical Classic 
(孫子算經) by the Chinese mathematician Sun Tzu and later generalized with a complete solution called Dayanshu (大衍術) in 
Qin Jiushao's 1247 Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections (數書九章, Shushu Jiuzhang), is a statement about simultaneous 
congruences.
Suppose n1, n2, …, nk are positive integers that are pairwise coprime. 
Then, for any given sequence of integers a1,a2, …, ak, there exists an integer x solving the following system of 
simultaneous congruences.

Furthermore, all solutions x of this system are congruent modulo the product, N = n1n2…nk.
Hence  for all , if and only if .

Sometimes, the simultaneous congruences can be solved even if the ni's are not pairwise coprime. A solution x exists 
if and only if:

All solutions x are then congruent modulo the least common multiple of the ni.
