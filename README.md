# Cryptogrphy_and_Network_Security

It covers :
- Few of the Programs in C++ of cryptography techniques such as -- 
  Playfair algorithm, 
  Rail fence algorithm,
  RSA algorithm.
  

- Steganography code in C++ . 
  Steganography is hiding message with other non-secret text or data such as images, advertisements, other text etc.
  The code includes hiding text in files by converting text to bits and using spaces. One space for 0 bit and two spaces for 1     bit.
 
- Also has some programs of topics related to network security --
  Euclidean Algorithm,
  Extended Euclidean algorithm,
  Chinese remainder theorem,
  Linear Congruential generator for random number generation.
