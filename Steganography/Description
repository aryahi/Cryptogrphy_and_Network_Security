Steganography (US Listeni/ˌstɛ.ɡəˈnɔː.ɡrə.fi/, UK /ˌstɛɡ.əˈnɒɡ.rə.fi/) is the practice of concealing a file, message, 
image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. The word steganography combines the Greek words 
steganos (στεγανός), meaning "covered, concealed, or protected", and graphein (γράφειν) meaning "writing".

The first recorded use of the term was in 1499 by Johannes Trithemius in his Steganographia, a treatise on cryptography 
and steganography, disguised as a book on magic. Generally, the hidden messages appear to be (or be part of) something 
else: images, articles, shopping lists, or some other cover text. For example, the hidden message may be in invisible 
ink between the visible lines of a private letter. Some implementations of steganography that lack a shared secret are 
forms of security through obscurity, whereas key-dependent steganographic schemes adhere to Kerckhoffs's principle.[1]

The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention 
to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages—no matter how unbreakable—arouse interest, and 
may in themselves be incriminating in countries where encryption is illegal.[2] Thus, whereas cryptography is the 
practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned with concealing the fact that a 
secret message is being sent, as well as concealing the contents of the message
