In the following we shall consider methods for generating a sequence of random real numbers Un, uniformly distributed between zero and one. In other words, every number in the sequence is in [0,1) and the chance of being any number of [0,1) is equal. Since a computer can represent a real number with only finite accuracy, we shall actually be generating integers Xn between zero and some number m; the fraction

Un = Xn/m

will then lie between zero and one.

One of the most successful random number generators known today are special cases of the following scheme, which is called the linear congruential method. We choose four "magic numbers":
X0 , the starting value; X0 ≥ 0 .
a, the multiplier; a ≥ 0.
c, the increment; c ≥ 0.
m, the modulus; m > X0, m > a, m > c.

 

The desired sequence of random numbers < Xn > is then obtained by setting

Xn+1 =(aXn + c) mod m,   n ≥0.

Xn is chosen to be in [0, m-1], n ≥0.

 

This is called a linear congruential sequence.
